The class focuses on the theory of the Kalman filter, with an emphasis on problem formulation. It lasts 3 hours and includes a 15-minute break between the expository segment and the practical challenge. The session is divided into two parts:
* Expository Segment: Concepts are explained using provided slides.
* Interactive Exercises and Challenge: Students engage in exercises and discussions, culminating in a challenge that incorporates control theory.

Throughout both parts, students use a provided  Google Colab notebook  to apply concepts and solve problems interactively.
