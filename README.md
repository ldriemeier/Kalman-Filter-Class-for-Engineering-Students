The pre-class preparatory work is centered around a Google Colab notebook designed to alternate between theoretical explanations and practical exercises in Python. This interactive resource is inspired by [Roger Labbe's work](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python). The primary goal of the notebook is to revisit key foundational concepts essential for understanding the Kalman filter, reinforcing knowledge already covered by engineering students.
